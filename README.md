# Custom-Room-Kitchen
This submod adds a modern and stylish kitchen for you and Monika.


#### Hi! First of all: thank you for wanting to use my work! It means a lot that I can do something to make peopleâ€™s time with their Monika that much better.

#### Anyhow, right to the instructions. 

## Instructions:

1. Go to the "Releases" tab on the right this webpage (or click [HERE](https://github.com/tw4449/tw4449-Location-Selector-Main-Repository/releases)), then click on the latest version of "location.submod.zip". It should begin automatically downloading.
2. Unzip and open the folder called 'location selector submod' (it should be in your 'Downloads' folder).
3. From the location selector submod folder, copy the 'game' and 'lib' folders into the main 
   'Doki Doki Literature Club' folder (AKA, the folder where you see 'DDLC.exe').
4. Launch MAS, and the room should be available. Monika will explain how to use it after a minute or so.

And that's it! It's that simple.


## Other rooms:

I have other rooms available! You can find them here:

-[Spaceroom v1](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V1)

-[Spaceroom v2](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V2)

-[Spaceroom v3](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Furnished-Spaceroom-V3)

-[Den](https://github.com/Cdino11/Custom-Room-Den)


## Troubleshooting:

-If the rooms don't show up or if you get an error, most likely the files weren't placed correctly. Repeat 
   step 3, making sure to put the "game" and "lib" folders directly into the main "Doki Doki Literature Club" 
   folder.
   
-If the problem persists, there may another issue with your install of MAS. Go to the "issues" tab on this 
   webpage and see if anyone else has had the same issue, and try any solutions posted there. If not, leave a 
   description of your problem, and I'll see what I can do.


## Other info:

-At the moment, the kitchen doesn't account for the Halloween or Christmas decor (birthday decor works fine, 
   though), but we're planning on fixing this in an update before Halloween.
   
-Luckily, the game will notify you when an update to the submod is available, thanks to submod plugin we 
   incorporated courtesy of Booplicate (more info below). This plugin both notifies you of updates, and helps 
   you download and install them.

## Updating

Speaking of updates, if you get a notification that an update is available, go to the "Submods" tab in your menu in MAS 
(hit "Esc" to bring the menu up). In the Submods page, find the name "Submod Updater Plugnin" you'll see a prompt to update your submods. It will 
guide you through the rest.

## Acknowledgments:

This submod was truly a group effort, with 
[cdino11](https://github.com/cdino11), [multimokia](https://github.com/multimokia), and [d3adpan](https://github.com/d3adpan) handling the coding. It *literally* couldn't have happened without them.

Additionally, many kudos and thanks to [Booplicate](https://github.com/Booplicate) for allowing us to incorporate his submod updater plugin (its main repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Booplicate/MAS-Submods-SubmodUpdaterPlugin)). It's an amazing feature and tool for submod creators.

#### Thanks again for downloading our submod, and I hope you enjoy your time with Monika in your new furnished room!
